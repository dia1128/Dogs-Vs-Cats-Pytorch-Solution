# Dogs-Vs-Cats-Pytorch-Solution
I have built a convolutional neural network using Pytorch for this solution. I tried to keep the code as simple as possible. The most interesting part of this solution is to flatten the convolutional network. I found a trick from a youtube comment section which perfectly worked for me! One thing that I want to mention is, I ran this code in a GPU system and stored the datasets in my local machine.
